# ictools

*ictools* is a series of utilities that I've written to help verify the correctness (or incorrectness) of the results of applying simple algorithms. The tool is motivated by a frustration I had during my time at Imperial College London with past exam papers; no solutions are available for this and it can be difficult to determine whether.

# Modules Supported

- C220 Software Engineering Algorithms
  - Ford-Fulkerson (implemented via Edmonds-Karp)
